BlobSolverRuby
==============

BlobWars engine written in Ruby. 

blob_solver.rb is the entry point..

Program plays the game blobwars. The program expects as input 4 numbers separated by commas corresponding to a move to be made
on the 8x8 grid. I.e. 0,7,0,6 means you want to move from the spot (0,7) on the grid to spot (0,6). The program will then
ouput its own move with the same format.
